# Welcome to Alessandro's Profile

## About Me
My name is Alessandro, and I am an Architect.
I felt the need to abandon proprietary software and fully transition to open source systems. After studying and understanding the profound meaning and power of the "Open Source world," I decided to make this significant change.

## My Transition to Open Source
Tired of the limitations imposed by proprietary software, I embarked on a journey of studying and learning new tools offered by Open Source:
- **Operating System**: LINUX
- **Design**: FreeCAD
- **Drawing**: LibreCAD
- **Vector Graphics**: Inkscape
- **Image Editing**: GIMP

During my transition, I learned that to achieve what I need, I must understand the tools at my disposal. The spirit of Open Source taught me just that. I improved thanks to the sharing of tutorials and guidance available online from other passionate individuals, both young and old, creating an environment of continuous learning and growth.

## Sharing and Collaboration
I strongly believe in the spirit of sharing. For this reason, I intend to share some of my knowledge:
- **Architectural Components**
- **Design Models**
- **Ideas**

## Professional Goals
In addition to contributing to the Open Source community, I aspire to find new opportunities and am open to collaborations that could represent a good chance to expand my professional horizons.

## Featured Projects
- Interesting projects coming soon, stay tuned!
